This is a tool for removing unnecessary tags from your del.icio.us bookmarks.

If you're like me, you probably have thousands of bookmarks collected over years and years of web surfing and hundreds of tags used to describe them. But the thing is that over these years you haven't been able to come up with a consistent taxonomy for your tags.

You might have, for example, dozens of different tags for expressing links related to software development: "dev", "devel", "development" etc.

This tool can suggest you tags to be merged together, so you can choose one by one and have it merge the chosen tags on your del.icio.us account.

Examples of suggested merges: “book”, “books” and “ebooks” tags into a single “book” tag.

A live hosted example is at http://delicious.isnotworking.com/ but it rarely works as Yahoo seems to be blocking API calls from Google AppEngine.

If you have some Python programming skills you may try downloading the open source code and running it yourself using the Google AppEngine Development tool.
